# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End With Auth
In this rendition of the What To Wear project, using packages like bcryptjs and jsonwebtoken, we expand the existing functionality from the previous sprint and bring proper user authentication to the project. Now different users can log in, view their clothes, or modify or delete their clothes, but cannot do the same for clothes owned by another user, or while not logged in.
